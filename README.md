# divisors_rust

Programs to do with divisors (eg. find the smallest number with x divisors)

## FindSmallest

Finds the smallest number with x divisors by using primes factorization.
- The "res_divisibility" folder holds a pn-file that holds all primes up to 25,000,000 in it. Place this folder in the location that the program wil be running (when debugging: "FindSmallest\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1" for me) if you don't want to have to generate all the primes on the fly as this can take a while.
